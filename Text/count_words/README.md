# Count Words in a String

Counts the number of individual words in a string. Consider situations such
as hyphenated words, contractions, and appearance of non-word characters.

# Extensions

For added complexity

- read the input in from a text file
- generate a summary of the input
  - write to a CSV file the total count and words found
  - write to a JSON file the total count and each unique word tied to the
    number of occurrences of that word
